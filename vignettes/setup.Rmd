# Security

The API assumes the following:
- SciDB EE (enterprise edition) is installed. 
(Install instructions are [here](https://downloads.paradigm4.com/enterprise/16.9/SciDB-Installation-v16.9.pdf).
Contact support@paradigm4.com for login credentials)

Follow the steps below to set up the security settings for the API to work:

1. Turn on security for SciDB by following instructions at
https://paradigm4.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ESD169/More+Info
2. Set up the root user (instructions at 
https://paradigm4.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ESD169/Setting+up+the+Root+User)

At this point, you should be able to run the following:
```{sh}
iquery --auth-file ~/.scidb_root_auth -aq "show_user();"
iquery --auth-file ~/.scidb_root_auth -aq "list()"
iquery --auth-file ~/.scidb_root_auth -aq "list('libraries')"
```

## Create namespaces, users, roles, permissions

# Plugins and shim

The plugins and API can be downloaded and installed via any directory, but a 
standard directory structure is currently being used for development.

```{sh}
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/Paradigm4/extra-scidb-libs/raw/master/extra-scidb-libs-18.1-1-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -i extra-scidb-libs-18.1-1-1.x86_64.rpm
```

**NOTE**

1. Shim is configured using a file under `/var/lib/shim/conf`. 
2. Any configuration changes need a restart for shim via `sudo service shimsvc restart`
3. Other plugins required for project are:
    + `secure_scan`

# Package installation

First the dependencies

## LibXML 

- required by R package `roxygen2` -- only if you are building this package on the target machine
```{sh}
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
# Centos 6
sudo yum install libxml2-dev # need the Centos equivalent here (auto-prompted by R roxgen2 install below)
# Centos 7
sudo yum install libxml2-devel # need the Centos equivalent here (auto-prompted by R roxgen2 install below)
```

## LibPqxx-devel 

- required if you need to read some data from Postgres and then load into this API
    + prompted by R RPostgreSQL install
```{sh}
yum install postgresql93-devel.x86_64
```

## Libcurl-devel 

- was prompted by R devtools install (on a centos system)

```{sh}
yum install libcurl-devel
```

Next, install the following R packages from CRAN
```{sh}
sudo R
# Then run
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R"); 
biocLite(c("Biobase")); 
install.packages(c('roxygen2', 
                   'tidyr', 
                   'RPostgreSQL', 
                   'devtools',
                   'yaml',
                   'knitr',
                   'reshape',
                   'reshape2')); 
```

Next we install the SciDB related R package via devtools

```{sh}
sudo R --slave -e "devtools::install_github('Paradigm4/scidbr')"
```

## This API's R package

This API's R package can be installed in two ways:

### If you are just using the package

```{sh}
sudo R --slave -e "devtools::install_github('Paradigm4/revealgenomics')"
```

### If you are working on package development on the target machine 

(assuming the directory choice described above):

```{sh}
# Scenario 1
# When user `scidb` has sudo privileges
USER=ksen
pushd /home/$USER/coding/downloads/revealgenomics/; R --slave -e "library(roxygen2); roxygenize()" && cd .. && sudo R CMD build revealgenomics && sudo R CMD INSTALL revealgenomics_0.1.tar.gz ; popd

# Scenario 2
# When you are logged in as root, but user `ksenshar` has copy of package
USER=ksenshar
pushd /home/$USER/coding/downloads/revealgenomics/; R --slave -e "library(roxygen2); roxygenize()" && cd /home/$USER/coding/downloads/ && R CMD build revealgenomics && R CMD INSTALL revealgenomics_0.1.tar.gz; popd

# Scenario 3 
# As root, get package from github into `/tmp`, and install for all users
pushd /tmp/; git clone https://github.com/paradigm4/revealgenomics.git; cd revealgenomics; R --slave -e "library(roxygen2); roxygenize()" && cd /tmp/ && R CMD build revealgenomics && R CMD INSTALL revealgenomics_0.1.tar.gz && rm -rf revealgenomics; popd
```

# Package setup and usage

Now let us get to using the package:

```{R}
library(revealgenomics)
gh_connect('root', ROOTPASSWORD)
```

# CAUTION: Intitializing arrays here

![Caution](http://findicons.com/files/icons/2787/beautiful_flat_icons/128/caution.png)
```{R}
init_db(arrays_to_init = 'ONTOLOGY')           # CAUTION: To be used with care by DB admin only
init_db(arrays_to_init = get_entity_names())   # EXTREME CAUTION: To be used with extreme care by DB admin only
```
